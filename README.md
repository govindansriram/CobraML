# CobraML: ML for everyone
## What is it?

**CobraML** is a python library built on top of the PyTorch framework, 
designed to give users access to a whole plethora of ML models, which are trainable
on the gpu.

- Just like PyTorch **CobraML** gives 
the user full control when designing their model pipeline, 
  from the cost function to the optimizer
everything is in the users hand!
  
- **CobraML** recognizes that simplicity is also important to growing the ML community,
and thus has model implementations that are very beginner friendly.
  
- **CobraML** does have gpu support, thanks to PyTorch cuda availability.
  
- **CobraML** is completely open source and in the future we are looking 
forward to community collaboration and input!

## Progress


**CobraML** is in it's extremely early stages with only a few algorithms ready for production, and is thus not ready for release.
